As far as I'm concerned, 15minutes is done.

It doesn't mean it couldn't be improved.

A good addition would be ability to set the timer to an arbitrary value,
other than one of the pre-defined values.

Another good thing would be making time display a little bit more
attractive.

Creating an installer wouldn't hurt either.
